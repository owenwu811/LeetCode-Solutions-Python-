#You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2]. Each integer appears exactly once except a which appears twice and b which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b.

#Return a 0-indexed integer array ans of size 2 where ans[0] equals to a and ans[1] equals to b.

 

#Example 1:

#Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,2]]
#Output: [2,4]
#Explanation: Number 2 is repeated and number 4 is missing so the answer is [2,4].
#Example 2:

#Input: grid = [[9,1,7],[8,9,2],[3,4,6]]
#Output: [9,5]
#Explanation: Number 9 is repeated and number 5 is missing so the answer is [9,5].


#my own solution using python3:

class Solution:
    def findMissingAndRepeatedValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        #for i in range(1, len())
        tmp = []
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[i])):
                tmp.append(grid[i][j])
        print(tmp)
        needed = []
        for i in range(1, len(tmp) + 1):
            needed.append(i)
        tmp.sort()
        res = []
        print(tmp)
        for t in tmp:
            if tmp.count(t) > 1:
                res.append(t)
                break
        for n in needed:
            if n not in tmp:
                res.append(n)
                break
        return res
