#Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window 
#substring
# of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

#The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

 

#Example 1:

#Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
#Output: "BANC"
#Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

#explanation: ORIGINALLY, our tdict represents what we need from s to satisfy t: 'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1. as we find t's characters from s, we now say we need ONE LESS FROM S. if we shrink the window, we take the character - a - we kicked out of the left side of the window and saw we now still need one MORE OF THAT CHARACTER FROM S by incrementing the dictionary value - a: 0 becomes a: 1 - to say we still need one more A from s to satisfy t. 
#explanation 2: ONLY WHAT IS IN OUR WINDOW CURRENTLY can count towards our allowance from s to satisfy t. We only shrink the window once by kicking the character out from the leftmost side of our window, and if the character - a - we kicked out counted towards the allowance towards satisfying t, we must take this allowance away once since we only shrink by a character ONCE and increment the count in the dictinoary to say we still need one more a - 'a': 0 becomes 'a': 1 to say we still need one more a to satisfy t

#important: matched variable tracks the frequency of characters from s that have fully satisified t. so means how many letters in the dictionary have values of 0 - a:0, b: 0, c: 1 - matched would be 2 because 2 letters - a and b - from s have FULLY SATISFIED t

#super important: if you put "tdict[kickoutchar] += 1" before "if tdict[kickoutchar] == 0:" rather than after, then fullysatisfied -= 1 would never execute: to illustrate here, let's say it was supposed to be 'a': 0, which would decrement fully satisfied, but now that you've incremented it before, you would get 'a': 1, which wouldn't decrement fully satisfied now, messing up the result, causing the "while fullysatisfied == len(tdict)" to be true instead of false because you shrunk the window, so now s isn't fully satisfying t since the a from the beginning of s = ADOBECODEBANC is now gone from the window DOBEC, but this was never reflected in fully satisfied, leading to complete wrong results
