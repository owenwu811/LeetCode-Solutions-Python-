#Given an integer array nums, return true if there exists a triple of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]. If no such indices exists, return false.

#Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
#Output: true
#Explanation: Any triplet where i < j < k is valid.


#my own solution using python3 on 2/27/25:

#use a two sorted Lists to keep track of everything to the left side and right sides
