#Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

#Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

#p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3] - output True


#python3 solution:

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
